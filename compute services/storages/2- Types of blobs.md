# Types of Blobs in azure

azure provides **3** types of blob storages.

1. Block blobs
2. Page blobs
3. Append blobs

- You specify the blob type when you create the blob.
- Once the blob type is created, Its type cannot be changed.

# Block Blobs

- optimized for uploading large amounts of data efficiently.
- ! can store up to *4.75 TB* of data
- Large objects that doesn’t use random read and write operations. e. g. *Pictures* [source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29079268/differences-between-azure-block-blob-and-page-blob#:~:text=Block%20Blobs%3A%20For%20large%20objects%20that%20doesn%27t%20use%20random%20read%20and%20write%20operations.%20e.%20g.%20Pictures)
- Block blobs are composed of blocks, identified by a **block ID**. 
- ! Block Id can include 50,000 blocks.
- each block vary in size. [source](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/understanding-block-blobs--append-blobs--and-page-blobs#:~:text=Block%20blobs%20are,Block%20List%20operation.)
- These blocks that can be *uploaded in parallel*
- you can upload multiple blocks in parallel to decrease upload time.
- ! each block can be a max of *100MB* in size.
- Block blobs are optimized for read and write operations.
- If you write a block for a blob that does not exist, a new block blob is created, with a length of zero bytes.

- Each block can include an *MD5 hash* to verify the transfer,
- You can track upload progress and re-send blocks as needed using that MD5 hash.

## Create or modify a  block blob

- write a set of blocks via the *Put Block* operation.
- commit the blocks to a blob with the *Put Block List* operation.
- [source](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/understanding-block-blobs--append-blobs--and-page-blobs#:~:text=Block%20blobs%20are,Block%20List%20operation.)

## Committing the blobs.

- When you upload a block to a blob in your storage account, it is associated with the specified block blob, but it does not become part of the blob.
- until you commit a list of blocks that includes the new block's ID.
- New blocks remain in an uncommitted state until they are specifically committed or discarded.
- ! There can be a maximum of *100,000* uncommitted blocks.
- Writing a block does not update the last modified time of an existing blob.
- [source](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/understanding-block-blobs--append-blobs--and-page-blobs#:~:text=When%20you%20upload,an%20existing%20blob.)
- You can also upload a new block to replace an existing uncommitted block of the same block ID.
- You have one week to commit blocks to a blob before they are discarded.

# Page Blobs

- [page blobs, source 1]([What are Page Blobs? (smikar.com)](https://www.smikar.com/what-are-page-blobs/))
- ! Can store up to *8 TB* of data.
- designed to store and manage large, random-access files.
- when you need to read and write small sections of a file without effecting the entire file.
- Page blobs are organized as a collection of *152-byte* pages.

## features of Page blobs

- features of page Blob [source](https://www.smikar.com/what-are-page-blobs/#:~:text=Random%20read%2Dwrite%20access%3A%20Page,without%20conflicts%20or%20data%20corruption.)
	- Random read-write access
	- Snapshots
	- Incremental updates
	- Concurrency control

## Advantages of Page blobs

- suitable for use cases like Virtual Hard Drives and large databases
- 8TB of data can be stored
- provides data protection by snapshot functionality
- multiple users can work on a file simultaneously without conflicts or data corruption (*concurrency control*)

## Pricing

- billed based on the total size of the provisioned pages, not the actual data stored.
- even if you’re only using a portion of the provisioned pages, you’ll still be billed for the entire capacity.

## securing page blobs

- AD
- RBAC
- Storage Service Encryption

# Append Blobs

[source](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/understanding-block-blobs--append-blobs--and-page-blobs#:~:text=Performance%20Targets.-,About%20append%20blobs,therefore%20slightly%20more%20than%20195%20GiB%20(4%20MiB%20X%2050%2C000%20blocks).,-See%20Also)
- composed of blocks and is optimized for *append operations*
- When you modify an append blob, blocks are added to the end of the blob only.
- Updating and deleting existing blocks is not supported.
- does not expose its block IDs.
- each block vary in size.. up to a maximum of *4 MiB*.
- append blob can include up to *50,000* blocks.
- max size of append blob is therefore slightly more than *195GB (4 MiB * 50,000 blocks)*

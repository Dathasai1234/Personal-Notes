## What Are the Different Types of VDI?

Depending on your user needs, you can configure VDI as either persistent or non-persistent.

### Persistent VDI

Persistent VDI—also called statefull VDI—is a virtual desktop infrastructure implementation where end-users maintain their personalized settings, store data, and even configure instances that they can retrieve each time they log in. Because they allow full personalization, persistent VDIs act exactly as physical PCs.

They are popular in environments where end users are always the same—reporting to the same location and using the same workstation each day. You can also use persistent VDI if you want consistency and stability with long-term and full-time employees.

### Non-persistent VDI

Non-persistent VDI—also called stateless VDI—is a virtual desktop infrastructure implementation where end users cannot retain their data and configure desktop instances because they get destroyed after each session. Since they don’t allow any personalization, you cannot get the same experience you would with a typical PC.

Non-persistent VDIs are ideal solutions for frequent one-time access scenarios for a homogenous end-user base. You can use them to quickly provision and manage virtual desktops for shift, task and kiosk employees who don’t need to save their desktop instances.

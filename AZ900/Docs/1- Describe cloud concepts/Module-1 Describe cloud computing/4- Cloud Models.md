| **Public cloud** | **Private cloud** | **Hybrid cloud** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No capital expenditures to scale up | Organizations have complete control over resources and security | Provides the most flexibility |
| Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned | Data is not collocated with other organizations’ data | Organizations determine where to run their applications |
| Organizations pay only for what they use | Hardware must be purchased for startup and maintenance | Organizations control security, compliance, or legal requirements |
| Organizations don’t have complete control over resources and security | Organizations are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates |

## Multi-cloud

- you use multiple public cloud providers.
- Maybe you use different features from different cloud providers.
- Or maybe you started your cloud journey with one provider and are in the process of migrating to a different provider.

Regardless, in a multi-cloud environment you deal with two (or more) public cloud providers and manage resources and security in both environments.

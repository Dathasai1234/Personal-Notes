Cloud Computing is the delivery of ***computing services*** over the Internet.

Services like
- VM
- storage
- DB
- networking

Cloud Computing also expands the ***services of traditional IT*** offerings like
- IOT
- ML
- AI

## Advantage of CC

cloud computing uses the internet to deliver these services, it doesn’t have to be constrained by physical infrastructure the same way that a traditional datacenter is. That means if you need to increase your IT infrastructure rapidly, you don’t have to wait to build a new datacenter—you can use the cloud to rapidly expand your IT footprint.

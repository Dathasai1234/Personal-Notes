With the shared responsibility model, these responsibilities get shared between the **cloud provider** and the **consumer**. 

- Physical security, 
- power,
- cooling, and 
- network connectivity 
are the responsibility of the cloud provider. The consumer isn’t collocated with the datacenter, so it wouldn’t make sense for the consumer to have any of those responsibilities.

At the same time, the consumer is responsible for the 
- ***data*** and ***information*** stored in the cloud. (You wouldn’t want the cloud provider to be able to read your information.) 
- The consumer is also responsible for access ***security***, meaning you only give access to those who need it.

If you deployed a virtual machine and installed an SQL database on it, you’d be responsible for database patches and updates, as well as maintaining the data and information stored in the database.

The shared responsibility model is heavily tied into the cloud service types

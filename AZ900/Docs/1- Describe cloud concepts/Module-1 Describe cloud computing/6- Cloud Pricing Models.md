Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet by using a ***pay-as-you-go*** pricing model. You typically pay only for the cloud services you use, which helps you:

- Plan and manage your operating costs.
- Run your infrastructure more efficiently.
- Scale as your business needs change.

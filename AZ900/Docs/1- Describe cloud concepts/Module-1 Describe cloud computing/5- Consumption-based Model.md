When comparing IT infrastructure models, there are ***two types of expenses*** to consider.

1. Capital Expenditure. (CapEx)
2. Operational Expenditure. (OpEx)

- CapEx is typically a ***one-time***, ***up-front*** expenditure to purchase or secure tangible resources. 
- A new building, repaving the parking lot, building a datacenter, or buying a company vehicle are examples of CapEx.

- OpEx is spending money on services or products ***over time***. 
- Renting a convention center, leasing a company vehicle, or signing up for cloud services are all examples of OpEx.

This consumption-based model has many benefits, including:

- No upfront costs.
- No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use to its fullest potential.
- The ability to pay for more resources when they're needed.
- The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.

# Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you’ll be able to:

- Describe [[1- infrastructure as a service (IaaS)]].
- Describe [[2- platform as a service (PaaS).]]
- Describe [[3- Software as a Service]] (SaaS).
- Identify appropriate use cases for each cloud service (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).

## **IaaS - "Infrastructure is Yours":**

- In IaaS, you have control over the infrastructure, which includes virtual machines, operating systems, and applications.
- You're responsible for everything from the operating system up.
- Think of "IaaS" as "I" (for "Infrastructure") and "Yours" (meaning it's your responsibility).

## **PaaS - "Platform Provided":**

- In PaaS, the cloud provider provides the platform, including the runtime environment and scaling capabilities.
- You focus on your application and data, leaving the platform management to the provider.
- Think of "PaaS" as "Platform Provided."

## **SaaS - "Software as a Service":**

- In SaaS, everything is taken care of by the service provider.
- You just use the software application and your data; you don't worry about infrastructure or platform details.
- Think of "SaaS" as "Software as a Service."

Platform as a service (PaaS) is a **middle ground** between renting space in a datacenter (infrastructure as a service) and paying for a complete and deployed solution (software as a service).

In a PaaS environment, the cloud provider maintains the
- physical infrastructure, 
- physical security, 
- connection to the internet,
- operating systems,
- middleware, 
- development tools, and 
- business intelligence services.

In a PaaS scenario, you don't have to worry about the licensing or patching for operating systems and databases.

PaaS is well suited to provide a complete development environment without the headache of maintaining all the development infrastructure.

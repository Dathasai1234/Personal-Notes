# Governance and Compliance

 all your deployed resources meet **corporate standards** and **government regulatory requirements**.

- you can update all your deployed resources to new standards as standards change.
- **Cloud-based auditing** helps flag any resource that’s *out of compliance* with your corporate standards and provides **mitigation strategies**.
- Depending on your **operating model**, **software patches** and *updates* may also automatically be applied, which helps with both governance and security.

# Security

*If you want maximum control of security*
	 **infrastructure as a service (IaaS)** provides you with physical resources but lets you manage the operating systems and installed software, including patches and maintenance.

*If you want patches and maintenance taken care of automatically*
	**platform as a service (PaaS)** or **software as a service (SaaS)** deployments may be the best cloud strategies for you.

And because the cloud is intended as an over-the-internet delivery of IT resources, cloud providers are typically well suited to handle things like **distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks**, making your network more robust and secure.

By establishing a good governance footprint early, you can keep your cloud footprint updated, secure, and well managed.

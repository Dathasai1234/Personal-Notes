# Reliability

The ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function

-  the cloud enables you to have resources deployed in regions around the world. With this global scale, even if one region has a catastrophic event other regions are still up and running. You can design your applications to automatically take advantage of this increased reliability.
- In some cases, your cloud environment itself will automatically shift to a different region for you, with no action needed on your part.

# Predictability

Predictability in the cloud lets you move forward with confidence.

focused on 
- performance predictability
- cost predictability.

## Performance
predicting the resources needed to deliver a positive experience for your customers.

concepts that support performance predictability.
- Autoscaling, 
- load balancing, 
- high availability
## Cost
 predicting or forecasting the cost of the cloud spend.

- you can predict future costs and adjust your resources as needed.
- You can even use tools like the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) or Pricing Calculator to get an estimate of potential cloud spend.

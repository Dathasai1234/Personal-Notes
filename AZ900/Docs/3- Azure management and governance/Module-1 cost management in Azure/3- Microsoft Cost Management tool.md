- ability to quickly check Azure resource costs, create alerts based on resource spend, and create budgets that can be used to automate management of resources.

# Cost alerts

3 types.
1. Budget alerts. - (based on usage or cost, reaches or exceeds the amount defined in the alert condition of the budget.)
2. Credit alerts. (Credit alerts are generated automatically at **90% and at 100%** of your Azure credit balance.)
3. Department spending quota alerts. (Â department spending reaches a fixed threshold of the quota. Spending quotas are configured in the EA portal. Whenever a threshold is met, it generates an email to department owners, and appears in cost alerts. For example, **50 percent or 75 percent** of the quota).

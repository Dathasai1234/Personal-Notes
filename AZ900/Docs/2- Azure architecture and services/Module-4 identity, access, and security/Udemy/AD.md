# Types of Azure AD Users

## Cloud identities

- Identity that is created directly on Azure portal (or) cloud native user accounts.
- These are not synced to on-premises.

## Directory Sync identities

- identities that are synced from on-premises to Azure AD are know an Directory Sync identities.

## Guests

- When you are working with externals.
- You would like to manage permissions to them to access your VMâ€™s.
- The external users can continue to use their Email addresses to access our resources. SO we dont have to create their accounts in azure AD and on-premises

# IAM (Identity and Access Management)

1. Authentication (proving that we are who we say we are)
2. Authorization (the process of granting permissions for the resources **or** controlling the way of accessing the resources)
3. Protocols (agreed processes, agreed frameworks)

Authentication protocols

1. OAuth 2.0 (Access token)
2. OpenID (ID token)
3. SAML 2.0 (single sign on with A AD)
4. WS-Fed

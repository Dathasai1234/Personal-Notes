# Physical security

Microsoft maintains physical security at the data centers.

---
# Access and identity

provided by Azure Active Directory
Eg: Conditional Access, MFA and identity protection

---
# perimeter security

one example of the service at this layer is Azure DDoS which defends against Denial-of-service.

---
# network security

An example at this layer is Network Security Groups, which are essentially firewall rules for your Azure networks.

---
# compute security

To ensure that their Operating Systems are regularly patched. Fortunately, many of the compute services take care of this for you. But if you are using VMâ€™s, you need to take care of this yourselves.

---
# Application Security

Ensure your developers write your applications in a secure manner.

---
# Data Security

This is what attackers are usually trying to access.
- Azure offers a variety of data security features, such as
	- Encryption
	- Advanced Threat protection in Azure SQL Database.

# TCP

> Transmission Control Protocol

- TCP is a **Connection Oriented Protocol**
- Which means it must first acknowledge a session between the two computers that are communicating.
- So the two computers can verify the connection before any communication takes place.
- It does by a way called **Three way hand shake**

## 3 way hand shake

- It guaranties the delivery of the data.
- If the data package goes missing and didn’t arrive, then TCP will resend it.
- HTTP, FTP, SMTP are some protocols which uses TCP.

## Network and Communication

> Two computers connected via a LAN cable, sharing data with the help of *Network Interface Cards* forms a network.

> The process of sending messages from one place to another through a wired or wireless medium is called communication.

---
- The messages are not sent as a single unit. Instead they are *broken into small data units*.
- These data units are transmitted *through the network* and 
- *restored* at the receiver into its original message.

### Physical Layer

- The Physical layer is the layer where the actual communication takes place.
- The physical layer converts the binary sequence into signals and transmits them over the local medium.
- signal generated by the physical layer depends on the type of media used to connect the two devices.

# UDP

> User Datagram Protocol

- UDP is also for sending and receiving data.
- UDP is a **connectionless oriented Protocol**.
- It does not establish a session and does not guaranty data delivery.
- The source doesn’t care the if the data is received at the other end.
- UDP is also know to be *Fire-and-Forget protocol*.
- Because of less overhead that’s involved of not guaranteeing data delivery, **UDP is Faster than TCP**.

- DSN, DHCP, VOIP are some of the protocols uses UDP.

Here are the main differences between #TCP and #UDP:

| Factor | TCP | UDP |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Connection type | Requires an established connection before transmitting data | No connection is needed to start and end a data transfer |
| Data sequence | Can sequence data (send in a specific order) | Cannot sequence or arrange data |
| Data retransmission | Can retransmit data if packets fail to arrive | No data retransmitting. Lost data can’t be retrieved |
| Delivery | Delivery is guaranteed | Delivery is not guaranteed |
| Check for errors | Thorough error-checking guarantees data arrives in its intended state | Minimal error-checking covers the basics but may not prevent all errors |
| Broadcasting | Not supported | Supported |
| Speed | Slow, but complete data delivery | Fast, but at risk of incomplete data delivery |

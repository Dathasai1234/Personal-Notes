# Valid range

- *network* addresses range
	- 128.0.0.0 / 16
	- 191.255.0.0 / 16
- *host* addresses range
	- 128.0.0.0 / 16
	- 128.255.255.255 / 16

- number of *networks*
	- 16,384
	- Because the first 2 bits of a Class B address are always 10, 14 bits are left in the network portion of the address, resulting in 214Â or 16,384

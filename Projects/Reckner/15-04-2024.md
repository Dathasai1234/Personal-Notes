1. /etc/shadow file permissions should be set to 0400

**Description**
The /etc/shadow is like a safe place to store information of user accounts. Information like hashed passwords and other security information.

**impact**
If attackers get access to this file. They can easily break the hashed password by using a password cracking program. Other security information in the /etc/shadow file can be useful to compromise the user accounts.

**Solution**

- **Setting Ownership of `/etc/shadow`**

```bash
# chown root:root /etc/shadow
# chown root:shadow /etc/shadow
```

- The first command sets both the owner and group of `/etc/shadow` to `root`.
- The second command sets the group to `shadow`.

- **Removing Excess Permissions:**

```bash
# chmod u-x,g-wx,o-rwx /etc/shadow
```

- `u-x`: Removes execute permission for the file owner.
- `g-wx`: Removes write and execute permissions for the group.
- `o-rwx`: Removes read, write, and execute permissions to everyone else.

**impact**
Which could lead to unintended network connectivity.

**Solution**
To disable Zeroconf automatic route assignment in the *169.245.0.0* subnet, add or correct the following line in /etc/sysconfig/network

```bash
NOZEROCONF=yes
```

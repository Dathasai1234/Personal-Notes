- That targets a flaw in a system ==before developers or the public are aware it exists==.
- #Zero-day_exploits cannot be prevented because they are known only to the attacker.
- Attackers attempt to identify vulnerabilities through researching and probing systems.
	- #probing_systems
		- #Scanning: Using specialized tools to discover active hosts, open ports, and running services on the network.
		- #Vulnerability_scanning: Running automated tools that attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in specific software or operating systems.
		- #Port_knocking: Sending specific sequences of network packets to trigger hidden services or reveal certain configurations.
		- #Sniffing: Capturing network traffic to eavesdrop on communication and potentially extract sensitive information.
		- #Fuzzing: Feeding the system with malformed or unexpected data to see how it reacts and uncover potential crashes or unexpected behavior.
		- #Social_engineering: Tricking users into revealing information or clicking on malicious links that can compromise their systems.
	- attackers use probing systems to **paint a picture of the target system's defenses and identify specific entry points they can exploit** to gain unauthorized access, steal data, or disrupt operations. This information is then used to launch targeted attacks or develop custom exploits.
	- Probing systems can be #passive_probing or #active_probing. Passive probing involves gathering information without interacting with the target system, while active probing involves sending data or commands to the system and observing its response.
	- The specific techniques used in probing will vary depending on the attacker's skill level, resources, and the target system itself.
	- Organizations can take steps to defend against probing systems by implementing security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and network segmentation.
- Currently there are online markets that exist that sell the newest zero-day vulnerabilities.
- Once developers become aware of the vulnerability, they have to quickly notify users and fix the issue with a patch.
- The #Stuxnet_worm used an unknown zero-day vulnerability in a specific industrial control system. The attackers used this to compromise and cause catastrophic damage to an Iranian nuclear plant.

- ! cloud-native application protection platform
- designed to protect cloud-based application from cyber threats and vulnerabilities.
<br>
- Defender have two segments
	- A development security operations (*DevSecOps*) solution that unifies security management at the code level across multicloud and multiple-pipeline environments
	- A cloud security posture management (*CSPM*) solution that surfaces actions that you can take to prevent breaches
	- A cloud workload protection platform (*CWPP*) with specific protections for servers, containers, storage, databases, and other workloads

- Microsoft 365 Defender provides an overview of attacks, including suspicious and malicious events that occur in cloud environments.

- **Services in Defender**
	- Security Posture.
	- Workload Protection.
	- Inventory.
	- Recommendations.
	- Regulatory compliance.

## Just in time VM Access

- Opening RDP port 3389 is not the best practice. When it comes to hosting infrastructure in the cloud, you always pay attention to reduce the surface area attack in your infrastructure.
- Key things to remember to open fewer management ports open.
- Just in time feature access works with your Network Security Groups.
- You can also control the duration of VM access using Just in time VM access.
- The Just in time feature is applied only when VM is connected to any form of NSG. Not when it is stopped or NSG is disassociated.
- A new rule will be created in Your NSG named as "securitycenter..."
- You can also see or apply the feature from defender from cloud.

# Alerts and Security Incidents.

- Security alerts are the notifications generated by Defender for Cloud's workload protection plans when threats are identified in your Azure, hybrid, or multi-cloud environments.
- Defender for Cloud classifies alerts and prioritizes them by severity.
- Alerts are displayed in the portal for 90 days.
- The alerts will persist even the alert related resource is deleted. because the alert might indicate a potential breach to your organization that needs to be further investigated.
- By using the MITRE Attack Matrix, Defender for Cloud makes security information clearer and more actionable.

- **security incident**
	- **A security incident**Â is a collection of related alerts.
	- Incidents provide you with a single view of an attack and its related alerts, so that you can quickly understand the actions an attacker took, and the affected resources

- Attack path analysis helps you to address the security issues that pose immediate threats with the greatest potential of being exploited in your environment.
- Defender highlights the security recommendations that need to be resolved in order to mitigate it.

# What is a Network Security Threat?

protects the boundary between internal and external networks, keeping sensitive information vital and safe from unauthorized users.

## Types of Network Threats

- #malware
	- The malware or malicious software are software designed to damage the target device.
	- ! Derived from the combination of two words: "malicious" and "software."
	- Around 30% of computers in the USA are thought to be infected with malware.
	- Malware is an umbrella term for several sub-varieties of cyber threats
		- #Keyloggers
			- keyloggers log the keystrokes of infected devices.
			- **Sources**
				- email attachments
				- downloadable files on malicious websites
			- **attacks**
				- Steals login credentials
				- Steals personal information
				- Takes regular screenshots
				- Hijacks the device camera
					- Virtual meetings can be compromised
					- Along with other sensitive information.
			- can also be installed via rootkits deep inside a device at the kernel level.
				- *Deeper-rooted keyloggers are uncommon but most concerning.*
				- Simpler versions tend to be vulnerable to standard anti-malware scanners.

## DoS and DDoS Attacks

[source](https://www.packetlabs.net/posts/what-are-network-attacks/#:~:text=PTaaS%20vendor.-,DoS%20and%20DDoS%20Attacks,-While%20hackers%20exploit)

DoS (Denial-of-Service) and DDoS (Distributed-Denial-of-Service) attacks shut down a network, making it inaccessible to authorized personnel or users.

- #DOS
	- DoS disrupts regular traffic by overwhelming the traffic with *multiple requests from a single system*.
- #DDoS
	- criminals flood the server's traffic with numerous *requests from different systems or devices (usually IoT)*.

It clogs the server and prevents regular traffic from reaching its destination.
